While working with Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual issue where a seemingly valid project setup would fail to build or start the development server.  The error messages were often vague and unhelpful, not pinpointing the actual source of the problem.  For example, I might receive a generic 'Error: Command failed' message without further details. This happened despite the project seemingly adhering to all documented best practices, including properly configured package.json, app.json, and other relevant files.
