# Expo CLI Unclear Build/Start Errors

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo CLI where seemingly valid projects fail to build or start the development server. The error messages are vague and not helpful in debugging.

## Bug Description
A project correctly configured using Expo's best practices would unexpectedly fail during the build or start process.  Generic error messages without specifics made debugging challenging. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Attempt to run `expo start`.
4. Observe the vague error message.

## Solution
The problem was due to an unhandled exception in the project. Although the specific cause varied from project to project, the resolution involved a combination of:
  - Careful review of each dependencies and versions
  - Cleaning the project's cache
  - Checking for conflicting packages or dependencies
  - Ensuring all packages and dependencies were correctly installed
  - Updating Expo CLI
